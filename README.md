# Bengaluru Real Estate Price Estimation
This project aims to estimate real estate prices in Bengaluru using machine learning algorithms. The estimation is based on various features such as the area, square footage, number of bathrooms, and other relevant factors.

# Project Overview
Accurately predicting real estate prices is essential for buyers, sellers, and investors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide price estimates based on historical data and relevant property features.

# Features
Area: The locality of the property.
Square Feet: The total built-up area of the property.
Number of Bathrooms: The total number of bathrooms in the property.
Other Features: Additional features can include the number of bedrooms, age of the property, availability of amenities, etc.
# Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models are employed to ensure accurate price predictions. These may include:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
Neural Networks
# Data Collection
The dataset used for training and testing the models is collected from various sources including property listing websites, government records, and real estate agents. The data includes information about the location, size, price, and other relevant attributes of properties in Bengaluru.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:

Handling Missing Values: Filling or removing missing data.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Normalization: Scaling features to a standard range to ensure fair comparison.
Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format.
Model Training and Evaluation
The models are trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining data. The evaluation metrics used include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
